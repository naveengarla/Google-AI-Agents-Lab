## 📘 Unit 2: Agent Tools & Interoperability with Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### 🎧 Step 1: Listen
- Listen to the **[summary podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cr4NA6rxHAM)** for this unit, created by **NotebookLM**.

### 📄 Step 2: Read
- Read the **"Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP" whitepaper** to complement the podcast.

### 💻 Step 3: Complete the Codelabs on Kaggle
1. Explore new ways to **add tools** to extend what your agents can do.  
2. Explore **best practices for tools**, including using **MCP** and **long-running operations**.  
3. **Phone-verify your Kaggle account** before starting — it’s required for the codelabs.  
4. Review the **troubleshooting guide** for common codelab issues.

### 💬 Step 4: Interactive Learning

## 💡 What You’ll Learn

The **whitepaper** explores:
- How **external tool functions** enable an agent to perform actions or retrieve real-time data beyond its training set.  
- **Best practices** for designing effective tools.  
- A deep dive into **MCP**, including:
  - Architectural components  
  - Communication layer  
  - Risks and enterprise readiness gaps  

The **codelabs** will help you:
- Create **custom tools** for your agents by turning your own Python functions into executable actions.  
- Use **MCP** to implement **long-running operations**, allowing agents to:
  - Pause tool calls while waiting for human approval.  
  - Resume execution once approved.
